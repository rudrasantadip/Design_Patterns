"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the correctness of the program."

let us say we have a bird class with a fly() method,

now we created three sub classes for it
Sparrow
Eagle 
Penguin

now here the Penguin will not be able to invoke the Fly method, since Penguins cannot fly.
now this is a violation of the Liskov's Substitution Principle, as theoritically
all the subclasses must be able to substitute the parent class.
But the penguin here makes an exception...

so we change our appraoch of designing this relationship
