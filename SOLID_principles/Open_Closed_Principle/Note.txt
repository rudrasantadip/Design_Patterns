Open Closed Principle states that
all entities in software let them be classes, interfaces, functions or modules
once they are created they should not be subjected to anykind of modification.
If at all any modification or newer feature is required we can extend that particular 
entity inherit its features and add our new features to the new entity

for example if we have a cook, who can create continental dishes,
now if we want to calculate area for different shapes, 
what we can do is create a Shape interface and build other classes on top of it.
